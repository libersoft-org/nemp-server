# Installation and configuration of NEMP server

## Before the installation

Before you start the server installation, you need to have Linux server with root access and your own domain name.

Then add this domain record in your DNS for your new mail server:

- **A** record of your new mail server, eg.: **A - mail.domain.tld** targeting your new mail server IP address

Now for each domain you'd like to use with your new mail server add this record:

- **TXT** record that identifies your new mail server, eg.: **domain.tld TXT nemp=mail.domain.tld**

## Installation

These are the installation instructions of this software for the different Linux distributions.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: It is recommended to install this software on a clean OS installation, otherwise it may cause that other software previously installed on your server could stop working properly due to this. You are using this software at your own risk.

```console
apt update
apt -y upgrade
apt -y install curl git screen certbot
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_19.x | bash -
apt -y install nodejs 
git clone https://github.com/libersoft-org/nemp-server.git
cd nemp-server/src/
npm i
```

### CentOS / RHEL / Fedora Linux

Log in as "root" on your server and run the following commands to download the necessary dependencies and the latest version of this software from GitHub:

```console
dnf -y update
dnf -y install git curl screen certbot
curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_19.x | bash -
dnf -y install nodejs
git clone https://github.com/libersoft-org/nemp-server.git
cd nemp-server/src/
npm i
```

## Configuration

**1. After the installation is completed, you need to create a new server settings file using:**

```console
node index.js --create-settings
```

**2. Get your HTTPS certificate. This can be done automatically or manually.**

- Automatically:

```console
./cert.sh
```

This script will automatically replace the path to the certificate in your server settings file.

- Manually:

```console
letsencrypt certonly --standalone --register-unsafely-without-email --agree-tos -d **mail.domain.tld**
```

(replace **mail.domain.tld** with your new e-mail server domain address)

Then edit the **settings.json** file and replace **$DOMAIN** to your new e-mail server domain address as well.

**3. To set up the certificate auto renewal edit crontab using:**

```console
crontab -e
```

... and add this line at the end:

```console
0 12 * * * /usr/bin/letsencrypt renew --quiet
```

**4. Create a new database file using:**

```console
node index.js --create-database
```

If you need some additional configuration, just edit the **settings.json** file.

## Start the server

Now you can just start the server using:

```console
./start.sh
```

You can attach the server screen using:

```console
screen -x nemp
```

To detach screen press **CTRL+A** and then **CTRL+D**.

Alternatively you can run server without using **screen** by:

```console
node index.js
```

To stop the server just press **CTRL+C**.
