# The New E-mail Protocol (NEMP) server

The classic e-mail protocol is more than 40 years old and has been very little modified since the mid-1990s. It lacks modern features.

This project aims to replace the existing e-mail protocols (SMTP, IMAP, POP3 etc.) using modern technologies. It is very easy to install and it is all-in-one (server, web admin, web mail client, console (cli) client etc.). It takes all the advantages from classic e-mail protocol, such as:

- Decentralized server structure
- Aliases
- Notifications (from servers, IoT devices etc.)
- Newsgroups
- Login identity for other software
- Newsletters
- etc.

... and connects it with modern features like:

- Instant messaging
- Voice and video messages
- Voice and video calls
- Large file transfers
- End-to-end encryption
- etc.
