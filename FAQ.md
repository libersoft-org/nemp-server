# Frequently asked questions

## Is NEMP an e-mail or instant messenger?

NEMP is primarily the new generation of e-mail protocol. It replaces the old e-mail protocols (SMTP, IMAP, POP3 etc.). It combines the advantages of classic e-mail protocols with modern instant messaging features.

The advantages of classic e-mail protocols:

- Decentralized server structure
- Aliases
- Automated messages (from servers, IoT devices etc.)
- Login identity for other software
- Rich text (for newsletters etc.)
- etc.

The modern features:

- Instant messaging
- Voice and video messages
- Voice and video calls
- Large file transfers
- Encrypted data transfer
- End-to-end encryption
- Newsfeed
- Chat groups
- Chat bots
- Modern looking UI
- etc.

## Is end-to-end encryption important?

The end-to-end encryption is really recommended for everyone. Your personal and business data are potentially exploitable.

For example:

- You don't want thieves to know when you leave your home
- You don't want your personal photos and videos to be published online
- You don't want hackers to know passwords and other sensitive data to other services you're using and potentionaly delete your data or blackmail you
- You don't want anyone to know your location
- You don't want your business competitors to know your vendors, customers and other business data

These are just few examples, there are many more.

Encrypt your data and don't trust the software that's not open source!

## Is decentralization important?

In today world, some governments and big corporations are continously censoring users' content, decentralization is extremely important. Even if you run centrally a free and open source service like Signal, some governments can push you to censor some content or they can easily block your servers.

For example WhatsApp and many other centraly run messaging services are blocked in China which leads to inaccessibility of such service for more than 1 billion of people in China.

Running the decentralized network of messaging servers can resolve this problem. Classic e-mail servers are decentralized. Everyone is able to buy a domain and VPS for cheap and run their own e-mail server. Most of the e-mail servers are not banned even in countries like China, where government is hugely blocking many foreign servers. This is why NEMP is also decentralized.

## Matrix protocol is also open source, decentralized and has end-to-end encryption. How does it differ from NEMP?

Matrix protocol is really an interesting software and together with NEMP it is probably the only software that is open source, has end-to-end encryption and a decentralized server structure. Here are the differences between NEMP and Matrix:

- NEMP is primarily a new generation of e-mail, not just an instant messenger
- NEMP has different features like newsfeed, video messages, large file transfers etc.
- NEMP client has a nicer and more user friendly UI than Element (the most popular Matrix protocol client) :-)

## Is NEMP client backward compatible with classic e-mail protocols (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)?

Right now it is not compatible, but in theory, it can be done in client software to support both old and new e-mail protocol. Maybe in future this feature will be added to NEMP client, but it is not our priority for now.
