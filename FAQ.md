## Is NEMP an e-mail or instant messenger?

NEMP is primarily the new generation of e-mail protocol. It replaces the old e-mail protocols (SMTP, IMAP, POP3 etc.). It combines the advantages of classic e-mail protocols with modern instant messaging features.

The advantages of classic e-mail protocols:

- Decentralized server structure
- Aliases
- Automated messages (from servers, IoT devices etc.)
- Login identity for other software
- Rich text (for newsletters etc.)
- etc.

The modern features:

- Instant messaging
- Voice and video messages
- Voice and video calls
- Large file transfers
- Encrypted data transfer
- End-to-end encryption
- Newsfeed
- Chat groups
- Chat bots
- Modern looking UI
- etc.

## Is end-to-end encryption really necessary?

The end-to-end encryption is really recommended for everyone. Your personal and business data are potentially exploitable.

For example:

- You don't want thieves to know when you leave your home
- You don't want your personal photos and videos to be published online
- You don't want hackers to know passwords and other sensitive data to other services you're using and potentionaly delete your data or blackmail you
- You don't want anyone to know your location
- You don't want your business competitors to know your vendors, customers and other business data

These are just few examples, there are many more.

Encrypt your data!
